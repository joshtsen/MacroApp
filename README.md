# MontysMacros

The "Confirm Edit On Release" option (identical to my "auto-edit") was added to the game with v11.00 in October. I would like to think my posts in the various feedback threads contributed to this but it was probably already in their pipeline. As such I am no longer working on this project.

Without any editing macros, "Instant Build" (Place builds by pressing and holding respective binds) can be implemented using a simple script such as with "Simplebuilds.py."
